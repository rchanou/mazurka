#### Interesting insights from this:
- What, if anything, could be contained in the INIT event object?
- Separate concept of **"setup phase"** to make it easier to bring methods into the world of "purity"?
  - For example, `document.getElementById('value')` not guaranteed to be pure/idempotent in normal app, but this is just called on ce for setup.
  - Same for `store.subscribe`: it has an "effect" (can even be considered "mutable") but is only called once at setup.
- Related: Encapsulate HTML page?
  - Relates to concept of multiple possible JS "runtimes" to choose from, each with different guarantees.
  - One runtime can prohibit any direct modifications to HTML with the exception of an initialization config?
- Passing a bound function itself, rather than executing it, is a matter of calling it as a parameter of "bind"
- Speaking of types...they really would come in handy here, especially with the inversion of methods into independent functions that act on objects.
  - Those functions are still tightly coupled to the data structures that they were pulled out from.
  - This would help with "autocomplete".
  - Could have abstract types a la ReasonML.
- How should "standalone" mutable refs, e.g. **innerHTML**, be implemented via code?
- **innerHTML** is also a potential example of a "multi-dimensional" type, as it's both mutable and effectful (changes UI).

### Deferred Calling (Both with First-Class Support and without)

#### No First-Class Support
```
get-binder #fun
  . #fun 'bind'

bind #fun #args
  binder get-binder #fun
  bound binder #args

deferred-sum #a #b #c
  list = [] null #a #b #c
  bind $sum list
```

#### First-Class Op
```
sum #a #b #c
  deferred-sum $collect #a #b #c

deferred-sum-example 1 3 5

fulfilled-sum deferred-sum-example
```

#### First-Class Unit Input
```
get-days-in-week #
  dw 7

days-in-week get-days-in-week ()

sum #a #b #c #
  sum $sum #a #b #c

sum-test sum 1 3 4 ()

deferred-sum sum 3 4 5

fulfilled-sum deferred-sum ()
```

#### Insights Thus Far...
- Looks like this could work without first-class support.
- The **First-Class Op** maps pretty closely to `bind` in JS.
- The **First-Class Input** seems cool but may not actually map properly to a dependency graph, and thus may not hold water.

### Commit Stream
```

```

### Node Map and/or Commit Stream
```
0 /. /global Math 
1 /. /0 pow
2 /. /0 sqrt
3 /. /global console
4 /. /3 log
5 /1 /i1(number) 2
6 /5 3
7 /5 4
8 /+ /6 /7
9 /2 /8
10 /mark /i1 /5 
  // does this make sense at all?
  // Possible IDs of these generated nodes:
  // /10.i1, /10.5
  // /0.i1, /0.5   // first marked flow
11 /copy /10       // or /copy /i1 /5 ? Would this really work programmatically?
12 /1 /i3 2
13 /2 /11 /12
14 
```

#### Insights...
- How should the ID of a given node be determined?
  - Assigning a numeric ID is essentially a "memoization", which I think is fine.
  - Do the inputs have IDs themselves?
    - Facilitates attaching comments, etc.
    - Final Conclusion: **Yes**
- What's the best way to represent IDs of "second-order" nodes: nodes not directly created by the user, but as a result of the various copy operations such as **Branch** and **Fork**?
  - Operation themselves become ID paths.
  - Any way to efficiently represent **Instance**? This is just like a function call, but the naive approach would be to copy a flow and swap out the **Inputs** ("parameters"). I think this is an optimization and we can cross that bridge when we get to it.
  - Any other way possible?
- Keep Group Operations in a Separate Stream? 
- How 'Bout Dis: Create Regular Nodes But Keep Track Of Their "Origin Story" as Metadata
  - Brilliant, no? In line with programming as "discovery"
  - Makes sense logically and is optimized
  - Consistent with "most of this is just metadata" philosophy (e.g. names, types)
  - Does it Really Make Sense Doe?
- Breakthrough: Most Inputs should actually be conceptualized as copy operations?
  - Copying one Input creates copies of all dependent values
  - Inputs are a form of Typing if you think about it
  - Defines a space of possible values rather than a single one

### Flow Groups as Metadata

#### Nodes
```
0 /. /global Math 
1 /. /0 pow
2 /. /0 sqrt
3 /. /global console
4 /. /3 log
5 /1 3 2
6 /1 4 2
7 /+ /5 /6
8 /2 /7
9 /1 /i1(number) 2
10 /1 /i2(number) 2
11 /+ /9 /10
12 /2 /11
13 /m0 /i3 /i4 - Pythagorean Call
14 /m2 4

```

#### Marks
```
0 /9 /10 /12
```

#### Copy Operation ("Function" or "Macro")
```
m0 /a /b - Pythagorean
0 /1 /a 2
1 /1 /b 2
2 /+ /.0 /.1
3 /2 /.2

m1 /a /b /c - Any N Pythagorean
0 /1 /a /c
1 /1 /b /c
2 /+ /.0 /.1
3 /2 /.2

m2 /n - 3D+ Pythagorean (Higher-Order Macro?)
0 for x=0..n
  .x /1 /i.0.x 2
1 /+ ... /.0
2 /2 /.2
```

```
m2 expanded
0 /m2 4
0.0.0 /1 /i.0.0 2
0.0.1 /1 /i.0.1 2
0.0.2 /1 /i.0.2 2
0.0.3 /1 /i.0.3 2
0.1 /+ /0.0.0 /0.0.1 /0.0.2 /0.0.3
0.2 /2 /0.1
```

#### Insights
- These programs can never actually call functions generated from **Inputs** at static compile time. **Inputs** are strictly reserved for runtime.
- Rather, to generate desired values at compile time, you just apply commits.
- Ultimately, environment initialization and event handlers are what used the functions generated from Input connections.
- Every commit explores/reveals/"uses" new nodes.
- Creating a "function" is essentially an act of label creation?
